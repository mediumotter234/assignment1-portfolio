		<h3>CONTEXT</h3>
			<!-- <div class="center-fig">			
				<figure>
					<img src="interfacesketch.png" alt="interface sketch" width="600" height="450">
					<figcaption>
						<b>Figure 1.</b> A publicly available laundry washing machine. The key components involve the lid which opens upwards
						at the top of the machine, an instructions diagram on the bottom of the lid, a sliding tray with coin slots, cycle and temperature
						setting knobs, a start button, and a series of small lights indicating cycle status.

		<p>I stepped into a user's shoes by observing real users interacting with the shared laundry machines in my dorm,
		developing personas and generating a storyboard based off my observations.

		
		
		<h3>OBSERVATIONS</h3>
			<p>A few of my key observations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> All users tried to press the sliding tray in at least two times before they heard the rattling sound of the
					quarters falling into the
					machine.
				</li>
				<li>
					Multiple users closed and opened the lid of the washer to get another look at the instructions.
				</li>
				<li>
					All users hesitated when setting a timer on their phones.
				</li>
			</ul>
		<h3>QUESTIONS</h3>
			<p>
				I ased the following questions to users of the interface:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Do you feel like you used the interface as intended?</li>		
				<li>Did you find the instructions for use of the washer easy to find and understand?</li>	
				<li>Did you feel like there was enough relevant information presented on the interface?</li>		
				<li>How will you decide what time youâ€™ll return to the machine?</li>			
				<li>Rank the following in order of importance for you for this interface: ease of use, quality of result, price.</li>
			</ul>

		<h3>RESPONSES</h3>
		
		<p>Summaries of the responses to the questions above:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Users felt they used the interface as intended and instructions were easy to understand, but took issue with how the
				instructions were presented.</li>
				<li>
					All the users said the cycle status panel would have been more helpful if they knew roughly how long each step
					usually took.
				</li>
				<li>
				All the users said they had to guess based on previous experiences for how long the washing would take.
				</li>
				<li>
				Two users said the process of using the machine took longer than they expected.
				</li>
				<li>
					All the users ranked price last in importance, with quality of result and ease of use varying between first and
					second
					most important.
				</li>
			</ul>
		
		<h3> PERSONA EMPATHY MAPS </h3>
		<p>
			I created two empathy maps, one for each of the two different personas I constructed based on overarching trends I observed amongst all the users I interviewed.
		</p>
			<div class ="img-gallery">
				<figure>
					<img src="ingrid.png" alt="ingrid empathy" width="500" height="450">
					<figcaption>
						<br>
						Ingrid is inexperienced with doing laundry and has never used these types of machines before. 
						<br>
						<br>
						She has lots of questions about how to use the machine, including how to pay, how long a cycle will take, and 
						what order to do certain things.
						Most importantly, she finds the way that the instructions themselves are displayed especially unhelpful due to
						them being on the underside of the lid.
						<br>
						<br>
						Ingrid's character represents the uncertainty that I observed among nearly all users of the laundry machine.
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<figure>
					<img src="brandon.png" alt="brandon empathy" width="500" height="450">
					<figcaption>
						<br>
						Brandon has a really packed schedule today, so he's in a rush to get his load in and get to his next task.
						<br>
						<br>
						He mostly knows what he's doing, but has frustrations with the design of the laundry machine interface. His biggest gripe
						is not knowing how long the cycle will take, which is unconducive to helping him plan around his schedule.
						<br>
						<br>
						Brandon's character represents the annoyance at lack of information that came from some of the users I observed.

		<h3> STORYBOARD </h3>
		<p>Here's a storyboard for Ingrid's persona:</p>
		<div class="img-gallery">
			<figure>
				<img src="Laundry_Storyboard /frame-0001.jpg" alt="frame 1" width="300" height="210">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Frame 1</b>: Ingrid heads downstairs to the public laundry room. This is her first time using these specific laundry washer machines.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Laundry_Storyboard /frame-0002.jpg" alt="frame 2" width="300" height="210">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Frame 2</b>: Ingrid starts off by opening the lid of the washing machine and reading the listed instructions on the underside of the
					lid.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Laundry_Storyboard /frame-0003.jpg" alt="frame 3" width="300" height="210">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Frame 3</b>: After reading the first few steps, she puts her detergent in first, and then her dirty clothes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Laundry_Storyboard /frame-0004.jpg" alt="frame 4" width="300" height="210">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Frame 4</b>: Ingrid closes the lid, ready to proceed, but realizes she doesn't know what exactly to do next, 
					because the instructions were on the bottom of the lid.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Laundry_Storyboard /frame-0005.jpg" alt="frame 5" width="300" height="210">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Frame 5</b>: She opens the lid to read the instructions again.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Laundry_Storyboard /frame-0006.jpg" alt="frame 6" width="300" height="210">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Frame 6</b>: Ingrid sets the options for cycle type and temperature using the knobs on the interface.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Laundry_Storyboard /frame-0007.jpg" alt="frame 7" width="300" height="210">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Frame 7</b>: Next, according to the instructions, she places her coins in the slots 
					and tries to lightly push it the sliding tray in.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Laundry_Storyboard /frame-0008.jpg" alt="frame 8" width="300" height="210">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Frame 8</b>: She doesn't think she's done it right, so she pushes 
					harder and hears the coins clinking and rattling as they enter the machine correctly.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Laundry_Storyboard /frame-0009.jpg" alt="frame 9" width="300" height="210">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Frame 9</b>: Ingrid presses start and the 'in use' cycle status light turns green.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="Laundry_Storyboard /frame-0010.jpg" alt="frame 10" width="300" height="210">
				<figcaption>
					<b>Frame 10</b>: Unsure how long the cycle will take, Ingrid sets a timer for 40 minutes.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

		<h3> TAKEAWAYS </h3>
		<div>
			<p>
			All in all, I believe I was able to achieve a pretty thorough understanding of user interaction with the laundry machines
			by actually observing and talking to the users. 
			By thinking through personas and ultimately generating a storyboard,
			I was able to clearly pinpoint the general pain points in the interaction lifecycle but also take into consideration how 
			different users might approach the same task.
